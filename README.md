## Project Overview

- I chosen dark color because I like to use applications in dark mode on daily bases.
- I introduced animations to guide the user on what to do next if he gets lost.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Krystian000/tic-tac-toe
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the App

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server with:

- Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   This will open the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running Tests

To ensure your code is working correctly, run the tests with:

- Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
    
   This will run all the tests and display the results in the terminal.
